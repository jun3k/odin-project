            <li>2 cups chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped red peppers</li>
            <li>2 tsp. Minced Garlic, or 4 cloves of fresh garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. Corn oil</li>
            <li>1 can Tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 package Sazón without Annatto </li>
            <li>½ tsp. Oregano</li>
            <li>½ tsp. Adobo with cumin</li>
            <li>1 can (8 oz.) Red label black beans</li>
            <li>1 package Frozen ripe bananas, cooked according to package instructions</li>
            <li>3 cups Grain rice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a deep skillet, combine the meat, onion, broth and water. Heat until the contents boil, lower the heat and cook over low heat until the meat is very tender (approximately 1 and a half hours). Add more water as needed to keep the meat covered. Allow the meat to cool in its broth. Shred the meat when it is cool enough to handle. Reserve a cup of broth.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, puree the onion, red pepper and garlic in a blender or food processor.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shredded meat and brown a little. Add the vegetable puree, tomato sauce, Sazón, oregano, Adobo and the broth that was previously reserved. Heat to a boil, lower the heat and keep simmering until the mixture dries up in about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the meat, black beans, rice and plantain on a platter, and serve.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
